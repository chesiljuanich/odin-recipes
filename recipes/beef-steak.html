    <h2>How to Make Family Beef Salisbury Steak</h2>
    <p></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>cooking spray</li>
                <li>1 ¼ pounds extra-lean ground beef</li>
                <li>½ cup finely chopped sweet onion</li>
                <li>⅓ cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
                <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth, divided</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>¼ cup flour, or as needed</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans cream of mushroom soup</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 small sweet onion, or to taste, sliced thin</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prepare a large casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Lightly mix ground beef, 1/2 cup onion, bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons beef broth, milk, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl; divide into 5 portions and shape into patties.</li>
                <li>Season flour with salt and pepper in a wide, shallow dish. Gently lay patties into the flour to lightly coat.</li>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Fry patties in hot oil until browned completely, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove patties to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess grease.</li>
                <li>Stir remaining beef broth, cream of mushroom soup, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper together in a bowl until smooth.</li>
                <li>Arrange drained patties into the prepared casserole dish. Spread onion slices atop the patties and pour the soup mixture over the patties to cover completely.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, 45 minutes to 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
        <h3><em>Cook's Notes:</em> </h3>
        <p>This can also be made in a slow cooker instead of in the oven by moving the browned patties to a slow cooker, adding other ingredients from there, and cooking on Low for 4 to 5 hours. This is delicious served with mashed potatoes, buttered egg noodles, or rice.
            It could easily be made with ground turkey for a lower calorie alternative. I use all msg-free products and Healthy Request brand soup, and nobody knows the difference.</p>
